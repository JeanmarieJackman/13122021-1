                    <p style={style}>We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone that participated in Pre-Alpha. The suggestions and ideas which you have so generously provided to us will be integral to making Conquest & Virtue a truly remarkable MMORTS.

As a token of our gratitude, all Pre-Alpha testers will receive a free lifetime subscription to Conquest & Virtue. 

We have had several hundred players using the app and many more discussing Conquest and Virtue on Discord.  This input has been invaluable, and your comments have been - and will continue to be - instrumental in shaping the game.   

While we recognize that not everyoneâ€™s experience has been positive.  this is par for the course with early development.  Our goal here is not to be popular; we are here to make a game.   

We chose to open a public discord and to make a client prototype freely available.  We have been told that this is risky and not the way things should be done from a PR perspective. 

As you might have guessed, PR is not our top priority. 

We feel that player involvement during the planning stage helps to create a better game.   

With a great game, PR is easy--with a mediocre game, even the best PR will not help. 

We had originally intended to release the Alpha of Conquest & Virtue as soon as possible.  After much discussion we decided that providing a quality first release is more important than providing an early first release.   We are in this for the long haul, it is not a sprint. 

Quality is more important than punctuality so we will continue to work on the alpha until it is ready for all of you. 

At this time, the Pre-Alpha has concluded, and Alpha will begin next.  For those who wish to join, please sign up here:
